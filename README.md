# TikTok-Reports-Project

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. 
These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. 
The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim 
or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

Project background: Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset, Gather descriptive statistics, EDA and cleaning, Select and build visualization(s),
Explore the project data, Implement a hypothesis test, Determine the correct modeling approach, Build a regression model, Evaluate the model,
Interpret model results and summarize findings, Model building, Model evaluation, and Summarize findings.
